# scRNAimputeR
A effort to collect all of the scRNA imputation methods and allow them to interface with scRNA-seq libraries (i. e. Seurat, SingleCellAssay, etc...)

Currently, only the following work:
 * [ALRA](https://github.com/KlugerLab/ALRA/), though you can find this as an installable R package [here](https://github.com/milescsmith/ALRA/)
 * [AutoImpute](https://github.com/divyanshu-talwar/AutoImpute), though like above, you can find an installable Python package [here](https://github.com/milescsmith/AutoImpute)
 * [DCA](https://github.com/theislab/dca)
 
 The following are others I'm aware of and planning to include:
 * [scImpute](https://github.com/Vivianstats/scImpute)
 * [MAGIC](https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/MAGIC)
 * [scvi](https://github.com/YosefLab/scVI)
 * [DECODE](https://github.com/shmohammadi86/NetImpute)
 * [DrImpute](https://github.com/gongx030/DrImpute)
 * [netSmooth](https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/netSmooth)
 * [BISCUIT](https://github.com/sandhya212/BISCUIT_SingleCell_IMM_ICML_2016)
 * [SAVER](https://github.com/mohuangx/SAVER)
 * [scUnif](https://github.com/lingxuez/URSM)
 * [CIDR](https://github.com/VCCRI/CIDR)
 * [SAUCIE](https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/SAUCIE/)
